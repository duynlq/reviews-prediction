The LINE Austin,sadly never again we went to the line for a friends weekend and while the place was clean and most people were friendly we will never be staying there again we had decided on the line over hotels because my friend loves the restaurant apparently when the bat fest is going on it takes over the bridge under the hotel and half the hotel is unusable not that the hotel cares they booked the rooms knowing that the windows and bed will shake and be loud with bass until after midnight which would have been fine i guess if they d have mentioned it then the person at the desk lied to me when i asked if there were other rooms in the other tower he didn t even bother to look at the computer he just sneered and rolled his eyes then an hour later tired and annoyed with the noise i called to,August 2023,with friends,10
The LINE Austin,mixed feelings this is actually a hard review for me to write because i was treated very nicely by the staff but my friend who traveled with me were not when i checked in they upgraded me thank you the room was clean and pretty although the bed is very low to the ground beware if you have back issues the room had a lovely view and it was quiet my friend was put on the other side of the hotel it was next to congress street where they were having a bat festival that meant that the road was closed off and they were having a loud party there the dj played until midnight and might as well have been in the room with her the room actually vibrated when we asked if she could change rooms without looking the man at the desk told us there weren t any rooms on my side of the,August 2023,with friends,30
The LINE Austin,look elsewhere i ll start with the positives the staff here is very nice and the taco shop attached to the hotel is delicious however that s all i have for the pros the grounds mainly the pool area is absolutely filthy not pictured multiple straws and bandaids floating at the bottom of the pool everything is covered in bird poop and the wooden planks around the pool area are dangerously hot to walk on in the texas heat poor design i used the public bathroom in the lobby and found a dirty towel sitting in one of the stalls multiple other guests complained about the noise from the elevator keeping them up all night the ac in my room read 60 but somehow i woke up covered in sweat my first 3 nights not to mention the ac in the lobby was not working well at all this 4 star,August 2023,with friends,20

Hampton Inn Austin Oak Hill,car robbed in unsecured unmonitored hotel parking lot my parents car was robbed in the parking lot right outside the main lobby entrance the job was professionally done as the entire rear passenger window was cut out of the car unfortunately they were on a cross country trip home and had a number of items stolen the hotel said they do not have any cameras due to privacy laws which is just wrong the hotel parking lot is private property and if they wanted to have cameras to prevent people from being ripped off my understanding is that they could do so noticeably when they moved to a different hotel not far away the other hotel had cameras a fence and you needed a room key card to enter the parking lot to me that shows the area has this sort of thing happen regularly enough that some hotels take protecting their guests,April 2023,solo,10

Fairfield Inn & Suites Austin North/Parmer Lane,does not play by marriott rules i have stayed here before and it s not a bad location or facility and the price is reasonable i booked again for another trip but had to change to another fairfield property due to a change in plans the hotel did not honor the cancellation penalty that marriott assured me would be waived i was charged for two nights of rates when i escalated they denied the request from marriott corporate to honor the refund the fact that they don t honor policies and corporate rules means i will never stay here again there are just too many other options and that s a huge red flag for me the marriott brand is supposed to be trustworthy but this chain does not abide by corporate rules beware if you are relying on the marriott branding for quality control,June 2023,on business,10

Sheraton Austin Hotel at the Capitol,the noise factor dampened the experience this hotel is located within near walking distance to most things the bed was comfortable and my view amazing what wasn t good was the level of noise the room has no sound proofing from the music blaring well past midnight which i believe came from the property the 9am housekeeping knock my fault for not putting a dnd sign up but i check out today the drilling and vacumming of the hallways before 0930 was unnecessary breakfast is not free but the quality of the food itself needs to be improved overall decent for the price but come on sheraton i expect more,August 2023,with family,30

Hotel Magdalena,best boutique hotel experience for a group the team at hotel magdalena made planning a company offsite an absolute dream it was a seamless experience from beginning to end the location is premium with access to so many local spots and the rooms were beautiful and spacious we used the event space for a dinner and it felt like being at an amazing restaurant rather than having a catered hotel meal we couldn t have had a better experience,June 2023,on business,50
Hotel Magdalena,could be better a nice funky hotel right off s congress the staff was great the hotel is pretty cool and you can t beat the location a couple things first our room was loud heard pigeons on the roof traffic noise and the refrigerator beeped so much we had to turn it off pet peeve spend a lot for a room and the only fridge is the one stocked with items to sell you no cool space for you to use the room was very small and lacked a desk i will stay here again due to proximity to my son s home otherwise there are many places minutes away that are just as nice,May 2023,solo,40
Hotel Magdalena,great hotel but technical issues gave bad first impression technical issues with electronic door locks set a disappointing tone for the stay eventually had a switch rooms overall staff was very polite but didn t go out of their way to fix our issue and instead relied on me to make 3 trips back to room after a key resets before giving us a different room all while family waited outside room with luggage for 30 minutes once in the room the tv remote didn t work which is minor but with small kids can be key,May 2023,as a couple,30

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Austin Round Rock,la quinta review we have stayed at la quinta hotels before but this experience was not the best the elevator was broken the entire time we were there we were told that they don t do housekeeping services until we fully check out so linens were not refreshed and trash wasn t emptied the bathroom had a mildew smell and the bed wasn t comfortable it felt like we were sleeping on a board,July 2023,on business,20
Budget Inn Capitol,overpriced and bad experience would not recommend will not stay here again it s a cheap trashy motel that definitely deserves 1 star the floors in the whole room are tile which is super weird and i don t feel comfortable walking on them barefoot the desk chair is stained bed is uncomfortable they make you stand outside at a window to check in and out even during the day when they have a lobby but it s locked and you can t go inside which is rude and insulting the vending machines are also in the locked lobby which you can t access the wifi is so slow it is unusable they are also way too strict with guest policies and you cannot have any guests past 10pm which is ridiculous they charge an extra 20 night if you have anyone staying over the curtains on the window are not big enough and there are gaps where people can see inside they also do,March 2023,solo,10
Budget Inn Capitol,can t expect much for the price but really the room was adequate but a trash truck showed up at 4 am and woke me up the tv barely worked the reception was intermittent at best don t try to stream movies on your computer the internet connectivity was shabby,January 2023,solo,10
Budget Inn Capitol,absolutely horrible was treated horrifically at the front desk by a scumbag who refused me a refund after refusing to accept my id this man yelled at me before i even began speaking if there was a review lower than 1 i would give it to this place,August 2022,solo,10
Budget Inn Capitol,utterly vomit inducing treatment made the mistake of booking here was refused a refund on a refundable room after i refused to stay there due to the front desk lady s incredibly rude demeanor and her insistence that i not be allowed to check in until 4pm when other people were checking in no problems from the moment i walked in i was perfectly pleasant but got a scowl and nasty look right from the start from this sad middle aged hispanic pathetic angry woman i could not believe the experience i had in my short period of time there sitting in the lobby being deliberately discriminated against yes i speak spanish so i know what you were saying i later found out from a friend that this fleabag dump is mostly stayed in by prostitutes from the immediate area for their business purposes its bottom of,December 2019,on business,10
Budget Inn Capitol,only stay here if you literally cannot afford another hotel here s the list you should consider before choosing to stay here 1 in the lobby a sign says in large letters no refunds 2 the room was clean but the curtains over the front window do not actually cover the window so you can be unintentionally on display 3 two thread bare towels plus a hand towel only no floor mats for the bath 4 no hair dryer 5 no shampoo 6 two credit card thin tiny bars of soap 7 slow internet 8 no ice bucket 9 no place to hang clothes none 10 no clock the tv was nice but the bed was very soft and lumpy the price can t be beat in austin there is a reason for that,November 2019,as a couple,20
Budget Inn Capitol,horrible hotel should be closed i made reservation for two days i missed my flight i arrived the next day and they canceled my reservation however they charged on my credit card the staff is extremely rude and i was kicked out of reception for not having a reservation horrible hotel should be closed,March 2019,solo,10
Budget Inn Capitol,meh i booked this place because i was unexpectedly in austin over labor day weekend and every hotel was already booked naturally upon check in because it was a little later the lobby door was closed and locked so we all formed a line outside the area was not very well lit just took longer than anticipated the room itself was supposedly a deluxe or suite pretty much just had a big refrigerator but it didn t even work the sheets didn t really seem clean either and the blanket was thin and scratchy i ended up just sleeping on a towel and using the second one as a blanket didn t see the housekeeping service checking out there was a line the inn has a rule that if you check out 15 mins late you get charged a late fee i get charged this late fee even though i was in,September 2018,with friends,20
Budget Inn Capitol,exceeded my expectations after reading all of the bad reviews i went in automatically expecting the worse however my stay at the budget inn motel more than exceeded my expectations i stayed for a night and only interacted with two staff members and they both were friendly polite and straight forward i requested a non smoking room and that s exactly what i got the room itself was very spacious and clean there was a flat screen television microwave and mini fridge included in the room bed was pretty comfortable one of the only downsides was that it s located in a less than desirable neighborhood it s right in the hood and depending on the person this could be a deal breaker seeing as though i was only stopping in for a night and needed cheap accommodations it wasn t really a big issue,May 2018,with friends,40
Village Motor Inn,one of the worst dumps ever extremely run down and dirty cigarette butts everywhere smelled like old pee in the stairs our room smelled so bad we were unable to stay in it i nearly gagged lamps were rusty and the shower curtains stained it was extremely bad go anywhere but here,March 2022,on business,10

Village Motor Inn,terrible place on a recent trip to austin tx we chose to stay at the village motor inn based on some favorable reviews the reviews as well as the photos were totally misleading i can describe this place only as a dump even though the exterior and the rooms had received a facelift at some time we arrived early but were able to get in to our room by 14 30 which was the only good thing at this place the property is in bad shape uneven pavement uncut grass weeds and litter everywhere and the immediate surroundings are also run down there are no decent places to eat within walking distance the reception is a tiny hot and stuffy room there were absolutely no amenities in the room not even a box of tissues wifi was offered but could never connect there was a single,April 2019,as a couple,10

Canopy by Hilton Austin Downtown,bring your own linens the location on west 6th street is very convenient to numerous restaurants clubs and a short walk to the river about a 2 mile walk to zilker park and the barton creek pool which is a great experience if you swim you are not directly in the middle of the craziest part of 6th street but be prepared for noise and a telltale are the complementary ear plugs provided the rooms are laid out nicely with a sliding door that separates the bed from the bathroom and entryway the lobby is comfortable and spacious and the fitness center pretty modern and you can easily get in a good workout the pool is more like an oversized spa prepare your kids beforehand that it is not a swimming pool the big negative is like many competitors it s dog friendly as soon as my wife hit the pillow,August 2023,as a couple,30

Courtyard Austin North/Parmer Lane,bistro was totally unavailable and all staff acted like it was normal i travel extensively for business i stay almost exclusively at courtyard marriott facilities with the main benefit being the bistro i really loathe having to arrive after a long travel day and then have to go out again to find a place to eat having the bistro serving dinner is a real plus also there is usually a starbucks attached which is most welcome over room coffee the bistro and starbucks are also one of the most touted features on the marriott website when you book a room check under amenities the parmer lane courtyard was up to it s usual standards as far as the room was concerned but the bistro was a joke we arrived and asked for dinner and were told the bistro does not serve dinner only breakfast disappointing but so be it we came down the next morning,January 2023,with friends,20

Home2 Suites by Hilton Austin Airport,can t be beat best ever i have never stayed at a home2suites by hilton however we are diamond members and have stayed in about every kind of hilton on the planet this was by far the best hotel and it can be attributed to the staff jerrod works the night shift was so accommodating and our ride for the plane left before breakfast was officially opened and he got the items prepared so we could take breakfast to go they say everything starts at the top in this case it would be because of rick the manager that checked me in delightful and knowledgeable does not even begin to describe him the cleanliness of the hotel would pass military standards the breakfast is great the rooms are fabulous yet above all the hotel culture is one of the best in the united states this hotel represents all,January 2023,as a couple,50
Econo Lodge Austin,the most unsanitary and unsafe experience to be honest upon entering the room i considered booking another hotel for my stay in austin the only reason why i continued my stay is that my brother was with me if i was by myself as a woman i would have absolutely not stayed here the entire room was absolutely filthy to the point that we did not use the pillows and used blankets that we had there was dirt grime and make up smeared everywhere and blood smeared on the bathroom ceiling we packed up all of our stuff each day and kept it in the car and thank god we did because on the second day we came back and the room had been opened and the door hadn t been shut afterwards so all of our stuff would have gotten stolen i would never ever stay here again,March 2023,on business,10

"Extended Stay America - Austin - Northwest/Arboretum, TX",attitude toward breakfast is cavalier at best when i checked in it was clearly written on the welcome card that the free breakfast basically coffee tea and granola bars was from 6 9 30 most mornings it didn t actually start until 6 30 and that was annoying but i could live with that but today it was cleared away at 9 and i have to say i m pretty furious the front desk staff person became extremely defensive when i went back to my room and actually got the card and showed them that it said 9 30 this is just nonsense and extremely poor management the people who work here are overall extremely nice and try to be accommodating but this b s with the breakfast is 100 poor communication and bad management also due to covid they only clean the rooms once every two weeks gross to say the least,April 2022,on business,30

The Guild East Side | Indie,a very nice hotel but you will need to be fairly independent to fully enjoy the guild is a very nice hotel the rooms are very clean well appointed and very cheery they provide excellent texting service in advance but if you like a lot of in person service you may not like since they send you a code to gain entry to the facility and you have to navigate a couple of steps to get to your room also the place is difficult to spot from the outside i think younger guests who are very tech savy will be fine with this but older guests may find this a bit confusing in their defense the overall experience was very good and within the limits of mostly text messaging they were very attentive now that i know how to navigate the place i would consider staying here again,June 2019,solo,40
The Guild East Side | Indie,great place to stay with tons of room lots of amenities location was great many restaurants and bars and microbreweries in walking distance short lyft ride to downtown staff was very responsive by text and email easier than dealing with a front desk that never answers the phone room was very large and attractive full kitchen bathroom was immaculate with large tub shower combination wall dispenser for shampoo conditioner shower gel no little bottles to deal with very nice interior courtyard with gas fire bowl very comfortable the only negative was that the lr furniture was not very comfortable for lounging on bed was great we had a one bedroom but our room also had a convertible sofa in a sort of nook with a glass door which provided another sleeping option our room overlooked the back patio of the bar next door,March 2019,as a couple,40

Pecan Grove RV Park,secret gem we love this park the location is amazing for all things fun austin but the best part of all was larry and the community we ended up there during a freak snow storm and we were so taken care of by larry and our neighbors we were stranded by the storm and larry was so kind to us and our neighbors loaned us space heaters it was a historical events and we couldn t have been in a better place thank you pecan grove can t wait to come back,February 2021,as a couple,50

Austin Lone Star,don t pay for weeks in advance no refunds the facility was nice but i was working in the area for work work had me move to a different state and austin lone star would not reimburse me my money i had paid for two weeks in advance and they refused to give me a refund so i lost 673 60 i could understand paying a cancellation fee and then refunding me the rest of the money but keeping it all is bad business especially because they could have doubled dipped by getting my spot filled since i was leaving early,June 2023,on business,10

Native Hostel,modern funky professional clean space well designed and funky hostel big modern kitchen and large central space great staff and coffee shop next door community hub has lots of events and busy bar some nights rooms were pretty quiet however regardless curtain to bunks lights and power socket locker not super social as many guests were professionals working neighbourhood is close to the main highway underpath which did have some less fortunate locals however i felt fine walking through during the day solo female traveller with no car many scooters for rent coming and going suggest exploring east austin breweries nearby and la bbq stayed twice,September 2019,solo,50
Native Hostel,avoid at all costs i do not recommend staying at native hostel they had issues with the a c every night i was here and i was one of many guests that did not enjoy their stay due to the hot temperatures it was so hot it promoted a grown man in the bed next to me to sleep completely naked with the curtain open women should not be alone here every guest i talked with was uncomfortable and not enjoying the scorching temperatures at night i notified the front desk a few times and they told me it would be fixed immediately and would not happen again i felt lied to because it was not after the third night i could not take it anymore and got up and left at 12 30 am and left with no place to go because of the high heat josh at the front desk that night was apathetic and could care less about my,July 2019,on business,10
Native Hostel,lovely food in busy bar name is misleading it s not a hotel not the best part of town and not very impressive looking from the outside but once inside this place was pumping we had to queue to place our order rather a novelty for us at a bar but it went smoothly we had to wait for a table luckily we found one as our food arrived food was very good for a bar,February 2019,as a couple,40
Native Hostel,delicious happy hour menu this review is for the restaurant not a night s stay they ve elevated their menu particularly their happy hour menu with bold spices and colorful veggies that i truly can t stop thinking about the curried vegan egg rolls are made with housemade spiced seitan mixed veggies and a citrus chile sauce i honestly thought these were beef egg rolls they were sooooo tasty y all and you get 4 of them for only 5 also loved the sambal barbacoa tostadas served with housemade sambal braised beef peanut sesame salsa cotija and a spicy papaya salad two big tostadas are only 5,September 2018,with friends,50
Native Hostel,very good accomodation stayed at native for the formula 1 race it was an excellent location for the shuttle buses as only had to walk across the i35 and the bus stops were there the room and beds were lovely only gripe is that i would have liked more hooks or a shelf in the bed area and also a dry area in the shower to put clothes and dry off everyone was friendly and helpful and u would definatley consider this place again for a stay,October 2018,solo,40

Native Hostel,swanky hostel close to downtown i thought my hostel staying days were over but native hostel is a refreshing change from the typical grungy dorm bed style lodging you might expect first of all it looks very new and everything is spotless i stayed in a 4 bed dorm room and each bed has a privacy curtain night light two pronged hook and a locker for storage inside the room was a smaller room with a toilet and fan and another room with just a shower and the sink was in the common area between the two rooms paper towels were provided as was soap and in the shower there was shampoo conditioner and body soap the common area is very nice with a long table and couches and outlets for people to work there is a nice kitchen with lots of shelves condiments a toaster a refrigerator ice water available,September 2018,on business,40
Native Hostel,mean guests and way too expensive the dorm rooms have individual curtains and two showers per room but this is texas things are bound to get strange and they did fast individual curtains on the beds for privacy but 46 bucks a night is not a hostel price i got a cough and got cussed out by a stranger and accidentally slapped by large black woman who didn t apologize why are they hiring illegal mexicans in a hostel for housekeeping in a hostel you do a chore and then you pay less the menu is limited in the attached restaurant more like bar food aesthetic but rather pricey paying for the new kitchen no doubt i could barely figure out the high tech stove breakfast was the best by far though yogurt and granola fresh fruit and pretty decent coffee it was just so fancy i felt,September 2018,on business,30

Stay Alfred at E6,great place but this place was beautiful and spacious the instructions were very clear and easy to follow the place had everything you would need to enjoy a comfortable stay the only setback was the freight train that ran just outside the place at about 2 am every night for about 7 mins screeching and rumbling the whole place was filled with noise and vibrations for these times i would have liked that disclaimer before we booked that apt but otherwise everything was wonderful the location especially my sister stayed in another apt in the same building and they did not get the train noise so i would have liked the option of a non train noise place,February 2020,on business,40
Stay Alfred at E6,review accommodations were comfortable and location is perfect if you want to stay in the east 6th area unit however did not have coffee cups which was a big bummer unit 141 is right next to a freight train track that runs on weeknights throughout the night and on weekends is a light rail train that runs until approx midnight the freight train is extremely loud and long it would be wise to warn people about that situation or charge much less for that unit if the stay includes a weeknight which includes friday night,January 2020,on business,30

Austin Folk House Bed and Breakfast,know before you go i m a former austinite and if you ve read all of the reviews for the austin folk house you should have a pretty good idea of the common reason why most people stay here location and price it s certainly why i selected it downtown austin lodging is expensive as one might expect if you re in town for a concert a night out on the town or business at the university the location of this b b is very good at the corner of 22nd and nueces you re right on the edge of ut 3 blocks west of the drag about a 7 minute walk to the main building the clock tower and about a 20 minute walk to 6th street via nueces all in all a pretty central location for downtown activities the price is overall good comparatively speaking with free parking and within walking range to many,October 2016,as a couple,30

Austin Folk House Bed and Breakfast,quaint really liked this place we were sorry we were only going through town and didn t stay longer to enjoy the decks and walking the city streets food was way above other b bs we ve stayed at many choices no one would walk away hungry i read other reviews saying the area was noisy but we were there christmas week and it was very quiet it is really surrounded by the campus area so i imagine during school season it would be very busy,December 2015,with family,40
Austin Folk House Bed and Breakfast,comfortable very good value the austin folk house s website didn t have very good photos so we were pleased to discover that it is much better than the photos suggested charming with interesting art on the walls our room was large and comfortable and everything worked as expected the only problem we had was the room became too hot at night but we closed the heating vent and had no problem the second night because we stayed during a holiday period the street outside was quiet but it might have noisy traffic during other times of year we like to walk and the folk house s location was a good starting point for our treks around austin breakfast was pretty good and made this b b an even better value,December 2015,as a couple,40
Austin Folk House Bed and Breakfast,good place to stay in austin i enjoyed the austin folk house the décor is more down to earth than some b b s which can be overly decorated and too fussy the austin folk house felt very comfortable there s a refrigerator in the hallway where one can store food the breakfast was extraordinary i wish i had had room for more the granola is excellent there was a fresh fruit platter banana pancakes and a sort of egg casserole plus other items the location is more urban than i expected very close to the ut campus and some high rise buildings i was concerned about parking our car packed with stuff and too difficult to unload but we didn t have any trouble they usually require a two night stay but i was able to stay for just one night since it wasn t a busy time of year i compared,December 2015,with family,50
Austin Folk House Bed and Breakfast,good spot near ut if you want to stay near the university of texas then is as a good a spot as you ll find it s about two blocks west of campus the rooms are well kept the breakfast is good and the parking is free overall not bad but we did have some minor inconveniences the free wifi didn t reach our room and the late holiday week breakfasts 8 30 10 meant that we had to skip it on the day we left the neighborhood isn t quite as nice as it has been in the past lots of litter graffiti and signs of homeless living on the street but it doesn t feel unsafe,November 2015,as a couple,30
Adina,will not return the house manager was communicative but mostly to admit that they already knew about the problems we were reporting the place looks as pictured but you can t see that we had cold showers also if you don t rent the entire building don t even think about it the sound is deafening people simply walking in the hallway sounds like they are a heard of elephants right next to your head the other guests were cool not their problem just that the place has zero sound absorbing materials in place and they ask you to take your shoes off and leave them in a public rack um ewww i will not be walking in your public hall in my bare feet,June 2022,with friends,20

HK Austin,cancelled our booking ruined trip after spending weeks trying to get a hold of someone at hk we were finally excited to book and pay a deposit after reading good reviews we booked our flights and planned out our group trip however we should have been forewarned by their poor customer service in the fist place as they ignored multiple emails and calls from our group after paying our deposit and confirming our booking they cancelled on us without explanation or communicating what the problem was despite an offer to help us find alternative arrangements again they went dark and refused to follow through to make matters worse we got short changed by them due to transaction fees and exchange rates when they returned our deposit our entire trip is in jeopardy as a result do not rely on their flaky customer,January 2017,with friends,10
Quality Suites,won t be back this hotel was very strange the staff were super nice and were really trying their best unfortunately there are several problems with the building the automatic doors into the hotel did not work and once in side the sliding doors the next set of doors opened outwards this means that any one having mobility issues or in a wheelchair cannot access the lobby this hotel is in the midst of upgrading carpet in the hallways is new but sloppy painters have dripped on to it breakfast was disappointing the juice machine wasn t working nor the hot water dispenser to make tea as an advertised continental breakfast there should have been more pastries packaged blueberry muffins only and just white sliced bread for toast only fruit,March 2023,as a couple,20

The Quarters at Hardin House,friendly comfortable and reasonably priced but only when school s out my wife and i needed accommodation near ut for a conference in late june we feel we lucked out by finding the quarters online first by staying five nights we got a reduced rate that was far better than the official hotel s the office staff went beyond the usual to arrange for the same room for all five nights but we did book 5 months in advance and parking was free unlike at the hotel the breakfasts were definitely above average with lots of choice beyond the two hot dishes we thoroughly enjoyed the roomy common rooms on the ground floor and when we had sessions to attend it was only a 15 to 20 minute walk even to the furthest building on campus and shopping dining on the drag the guadeloupe st area across from the campus is only 5 to 10 minutes away,June 2016,on business,40
The Quarters at Hardin House,it s a dorm a nice dorm but still a dorm during the school year this is a really nice ut women s dorm so expect pretty small rooms and air conditioning controlled remotely the common area is indeed nice and the place is clean but we will not stay there again you can find a comfort inn or perhaps fairfield with bigger rooms and more amenities for the same price i m guessing i tried to use the two computers in the common area neither one worked and when i called the desk for help they offered no help the wifi instructions are on a card in the rooms and the simple editing in of one word would make the directions easier to comprehend for those of us who are tech challenged when we checked in we then had to sit and wait while the lady at the desk answered as bunch of questions for a potential fall renter,June 2016,as a couple,30

The Quarters at Hardin House,great location for anything ut related we stayed at hardin house for ut graduation in may its location is the most compelling reason to stay there it is within walking distance of everything on campus on a busy weekend like that of ut graduation where austin hotels normally triple their prices and book up a year in advance the parking spots alone at hardin house are worth the price of the room the rooms themselves are very basic think college dorm room the beds are ok the shower in our room was barely a trickle and although the room door locked it could be pushed open the included breakfast was very basic but good the temperature in the room could not be controlled from within the room so if the room was too hot a call had to be made to the front desk to have someone come up and adjust it which,May 2014,with family,30
