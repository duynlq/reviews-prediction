## Business Problem

Increasing customer retention and optimizing marketing resource allocation are critical challenges for the hospitality industry. I aim to develop an optimal predictive model that identifies customers at a high risk of churning from our services. Since we can sustain significant costs in incentivized marketing for churn customers, my primary focus is on minimizing the number of customers wrongly identifies as churn. By achieving a high rate of predicting customers who will actually churn, we can ensure that our marketing efforts are targeted towards the proper audience, and therefore maximizing our customer retention rates and reducing unnecessary marketing expenses.

## Data Source

- Our scope of reference is the **_first page of reviews_** scraped from the **_first 10 pages of hotels_** within Austin, TX on August 2023, sorted by Best Value. All first pages of reviews has a maximum of 10 reviews, but not all hotels in the scraped data will have all 10. It can be assumed that lesser Best Value hotels has a lesser chance of being reviewed.
- 2013 unique reviews were scraped.
- 294 unique hotel names were scraped.

## Quick EDA
![reviews distribution](images/scraped_reviews_distribution.png)
- Customers are more likely to put trust in a hotel based on its recent reviews. 59% of my scraped reviews are from 2023, despite having a time range from December 2017 to August 2023.

![class distribution](images/class_distribution.png)
- Class imbalance in the ratings distribution can negatively impact the accuracy of my models. Converting the target variable to a binary variable, in this case churn or non-churn, will serve the models better.
- It also can be assumed that there is strong evidence in reviews starred 4 and 5 that the customer in question will most likely book a room again or recommend it to friends or family, while giving constructive criticism for some minor negative experience. These customers will be put in the non-churn category.
- Likewise, there is strong evidence in reviews starred 3, 2 and 1 that the customer in question will either state that the hotel is average compared to others, gave largely negative comments to a majority of their experience, and frankly denies to recommend the hotel to anyone based on their entire experience. These customers will be put in the churn category.

## Data Cleaning Process
- **_Train/test Split:_** 70/30 was used on both the rows of reviews, and rows of churn/non-churn. This ratio is a fairly common practice.
- **_Building Vocabulary:_** To aid the predictive ability of my model, the vocabulary of words extracted from the reviews will include nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. "Early [research papers] (1) has focused on using adjectives such as ‘good’ and ‘bad’ and adverbs like ‘terrifically’ and ‘hatefully’ as the important indicators of sentiment (2). Intuitively, this is what we would expect of an opinionated document. However, later [research papers] (3) also suggests that other parts of speech such as verbs and even nouns (4) could be valuable indicators of sentiment."
- **_Premodeling:_**
  - **_Vectorizing:_** TfidfVectorizer() is used to omit terms that both appear in more than 10% and less than 5% of the vectorized documents of reviews.
  - **_PCA:_** Not all compared models will use PCA. PCA is used to reduce the number of features extracted from the reviews, while getting rid of collinear features which will end up in a single PCA component. Vectorized reviews are then scaled from 0 to 1 via MinMaxScaler() prior to dimensionality reduction via PCA(), since 0 to 1 scaling is a must for PCA.
- The vectorized and features-reduced reviews will now be referred as the processed reviews.
  
## Results
| Model    | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| :-------- | -------: | --------: | -------: |
| Logistic Regression       | 86% | 84% | 73% |
| Logistic Regression (PCA) | 85% | 84% | 70% |
| Random Forest             | 86% | 85% | 71% |
| Decision Tree             | 78% | 70% | 65% |
| Decision Tree (PCA)       | 81% | 74% | 70% |

## Assumptions of These Models
- **_Logistic Regression_**
  - **_Feature Importance:_** Provides straightforward interpretation, namely importance features stating which aspects of hotel reviews influence the likelihood of customer churn.
  - **_Commonly Used Model:_** It is a simple yet effective approach to modeling binary response variables (in this case churn vs non-churn) and can serve as a solid baseline model to compare against our other models.
  - **_GridSearchCV():_**  Tuning was kept simple with class_weight='balanced', C from 0.0 to 1.0, max_iter=100, and penalty between 'none' and 'l2'.
- **_Random Forest_**
  - **_Nonlinear Relationships:_** Can also provide features importance as well as capture nonlinear relationships between features effectively. In the context of hotel reviews, this model type can better handle the complex relationships of sentimental values within the reviews.
  - **_PCA Warning:_** Model was not trained with the processed reviews, since it does not perform well when features are monotonic transformations of other features, making the forest trees less independent from each other.
  - **_GridSearchCV():_** Tuning was first done with max_features and n_estimators, then criterion and max_depth, then min_sample_leaf and min_sample_split, and finally class_weight.
- **_Decision Tree_**
  - **_Customer Segmentation:_** Can also provide features importance as well as naturally divide the data into segments based on feature values, which is useful for identifying specific groups of customers who are more likly to churn based on their reviews.
  - **_Highly Interpretable:_** The dividing process can be visualized to be showcased to a non-technical audience.
  - **_GridSearchCV():_** Tuning was first done with max_features and max_leaf_nodes, then criterion and max_depth, then min_sample_leaf and min_sample_split, and finally class_weight.
- **_Side Note:_** As mentioned earlier, by achieving a high rate of predicting customers who will actually churn, or True Positives (TP), we can ensure that our marketing efforts are targeted towards the proper audience. Since we can sustain significant costs in incentivized marketing for churn customers, my primary focus is on minimizing the number of customers wrongly identifies as churn, or False Positives (FP). Naturally, this aligns with the need to strive for a higher precision.
    ![precisionvsrecall](images/precision_vs_recall.png)
-  **_FINAL VERDICT:_** Random Forest, as of development on 8/31/2023, was able to achieve the best accuracy and precision, where the other compared models could not.

## Limitations & Future Improvements
- PCA is known to perform worse for datasets with more features than samples. The number of "features" created by preprocessing is far too greater than the number of review samples scraped, which is only around 2000. Between "Logistic Regression" and "Logistic Regression (PCA)", with the ability to scrape a much larger number of recent reviews, we should see better performance for the latter.
- Random Forest also typically loses performance when there are more features than samples, therefore the ability to scrape more reviews is needed.
- However, Decision Tree is prone to overfitting with addition of more data
- Models compared can be extended to K Neared Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes, all of which can be implemented as binary classifiers.
